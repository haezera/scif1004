- At ~1:58, the doctor remarks "30 men dead yesterday, 18 before" - a representation of the momentum of disease spread that is often seen before tapering off due to either recovery and immunity, or by intervention (vaccination, lockdown, etc.)

- At ~3:40, the "supply drop" is found to be a bomb that clears out the entire medical camp. The decision had been made that the outbreak was too severe to come back from, and they had decided to destroy the entire camp.
- At ~13:21, we are introduced to a shaman of sorts. At ~17:04, we see him again; called "juju man" or a "witch doctor". The effects of religious and spiritual beliefs, as well as a lack of education in developing countries is a strong vector of disease transmission
- At ~15:30, a disturbing view of a child inbetween his two dead parents, all affected by a disease, is shown.

- At ~20:13, the general brings up the point that the strong lethality of the virus reduces the transmission of the virus. This should be tested later.
- At ~20:30, a Korean shipman feeds a monkey - animals are a strong transmission vector for viruses, and many viruses begin with animals and then transmit to humans from consumption and general interaction.
- At ~26:32, "Mr Motaba, Up close and personal" - the anticlimax of such a small thing wreaking havoc in our human bodies amplifies the fear of the the virus.

- At ~33:10 and ~32:30, two transmission vectors are seen - blood and spit (bodily fluids).
- The movie overall highlights how the human gathering patterns and clustering at points of interest (homes, theatres, supermarkets, etc) lead to a rapid spread in disease

- ~51:30 explores the discovery of the airborneness of the disease, and how improper management of healthcare facilities and neglecting possibilities leads to further outbreak
- ~1:00:00 explores the difficulty of containment and lockdown - but also how important the policy is to keep infectious diseases in control. How do we manage those who do not comply with lockdown? Can we detect all tests properly?
- ~1:13:00 concerns the decision to wipe out the entire community at Cedar Creek - and the impacts of decisions on how history judges.
